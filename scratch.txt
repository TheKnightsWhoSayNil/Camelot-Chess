Build a method that returns a boolean (true/false) on the Game Model  ….that indicates whether or not the current state of the game is in check.
1. get king w/ specific color
2. get all of opponents pieces which is opposite color
3. go through each piece and see if piece has a valid_move? on the king if valid return true if not valid return false


scenario:
I'm black player
black king is in front of white rook (in check)


game.in_check?(black) --> true
  (implies the next move belongs to non-black)
